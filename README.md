# Stereo-Vision
Code for a stereo vision algorithm to measure distance to a face. Code to measure distance based on a single camera might be added in the future.

The functions are roughly divided into three parts:

	-Connection to the camera's
	-Stereo vision computations
	-Outputting the data
	
This work will be performed by Raquel Sim√≥n Sabsay and Victor Schonk, in collaboration with H.E.J. Bosma, T.P. Breedveld, K. Koopman, J.N. de Peinder, and E. Tansug.

These files are used as main running files:

	-distSetup.py
	-distRun.py
	
Are used for the setup and calibration procecdure and the running of the system.

Other files are used to cleanup functions and actions. This could use some cleaning up.

Files in which setup and configuration are stored:

	-servConf.py
	-calFile.py
