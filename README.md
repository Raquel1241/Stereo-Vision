# Stereo-Vision
Code for a stereo vision algorithm to measure distance to a face. Code to measure distance based on a single camera might be added in the future.

The functions are roughly divided into three parts:

	-Connection to the camera's
	-Stereo vision computations
	-Outputting the data
	
This work will be performed by Raquel Sim√≥n Sabsay and Victor Schonk, in collaboration with H.E.J. Bosma, T.P. Breedveld, K. Koopman, J.N. de Peinder, and E. Tansug.
